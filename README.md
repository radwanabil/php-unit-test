# PHP Unit Testing

This repository contains examples of PHP unit testing using PHPUnit version 10. The tests cover a factorial function and a `User` class.

## Testing the Factorial Function

The `factorial()` function takes a positive integer as input and returns its factorial. The unit tests for this function test the output of the function against known values of the factorial function.

## Testing the User Class

The `User` class represents a user object with a name and email. The unit tests for this class test the creation of a `User` object and its methods.
